Instructions: Rick Hammer is a carpenter who wants an application to compute the price of any desk a customer orders, based on the following: desk length and width in inches, type of wood, and number of drawers. The price is computed as follows:

The charge for all desks is a minimum $200.
If the surface (length * width) is over 750 square inches, add $50.
If the wood is mahogany add $150; for oak, add $125. No charge is added for pine.
For every drawer in the desk, there is an additional $30 charge.

Design a flowchart or psuedocode for a program that accepts data for an order number, customer name, length, and width of the desk ordered, type of wood, and number of drawers. Display all the entered data and the final price for the desk.
